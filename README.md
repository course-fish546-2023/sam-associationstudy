# sam-associationstudy

I will download a set of reference bacteria genomes.

Once the genomes are downloaded, I will want to annotate them (or download the annotated version) and generate a list of all possible genes and then move that data into a sparse matrix.

From the sparse matrix, I need to choose a target gene, and separate out into two groups, those with and those without the target. 

I want to sum all the genes, and divide by total number of organisms in both groups, then look at the log fold or difference between the two groups. 

Sort the list by the largest difference/log fold and plot.
